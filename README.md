# üìù ReactTodolist_0808
I rebuilt [To do Lists_0725](https://github.com/michelle5434123/To-do-Lists_250725) with React to help user to organize their events. This React-based To-Do List application allows to add, view, and clear tasks. Tasks include a category, name, date, and description.

## Features
- Add tasks with:
  - Category (Work, Family, Me, or blank)
  - Task name
  - Date (defaults to today‚Äôs date)
  - Description
- Dynamic task table that updates as tasks are added.
- Clear all tasks with a single button click.
- Graceful handling of empty inputs (stores them as null).


## How It Works
- **State** `formDataList` holds an array of task objects.
- Each `input` is wraped with **`label` for accessability**
- Adding a Task: **`addTask()`**
  - When the form is submitted, `addTask()`:
    - Loops over all expected fields (`selectCategory`, `taskname`, `datename`, `descriptionname`)
    - **Retrieves and `trims()`** the value.
    - Stores `null` if the field is empty.
    - Appends the newtask to `formDataList`.
- Displaying Tasks: **`formDate()` maps over `formDataList` to generate `<tr>` table rows.**
- Deleting All Tasks: The **"Delete All"** button clears `formDataList`.


## Notes
- Today is dynamically generated using `const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];`
